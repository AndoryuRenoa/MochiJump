# MochiJump
Build v0.23 achieved.

This repository holds my first platformer game built with Java.

*Note: this project uses Gradle to manage it's dependencies*

/dist holds a runnable jar of a recent version build of the game 

The MochiJump App now can import customer levels built on http://mochijump.com

Recently done:

Focused camera to zoom in on and follow Mochi (improved).

Mochi now bounces off HairClipNPC objects upon destruction.

YLimiter object now defines how far down Mochi can fall before the game ends

Compiled using gradle so dependencies are no longer an issue for reproduction form source code

Should do:

create gradle built runnable jar // https://github.com/Opalo/stackoverflow/tree/master/45180264
