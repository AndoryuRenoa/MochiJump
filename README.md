# MochiJump
Build v0.21 achieved.

This repository holds my first platformer game built with Java.

Project RR is a test for the local app to be able to read MJLE's API:

Launched form STS/Eclipse IDE it successfully parses through all available "levels" from the API and returns the X coordinantes and Level name of the last one created

The POM.XLM has not been tested for dependency issues by launching with maven or compiling to a JAR yet

It need to be incorporated into MochiJump so that the user has the option to select a level from the user made ones on MochiJump.com
