# MochiJump
Build v0.21 achieved.

This repository holds my first platformer game built with Java.

Basic menu capability added:

Easy to do's:

Add keybinding in playable game to return to pause menu

More difficult to do's:

Create choose your level with database connection capability
Create a way to have screen follow mochi as he progress towards the edge of the screen. (easiest way I can think is to replace directional movement of sprite with the oposite directional movement of the other objects in the world)

As this is a working repository, at any time, changes in code may make current code available in this repository unstable. Dist holds a working version of this project
