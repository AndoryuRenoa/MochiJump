# MochiJump
Build v0.23 achieved.

This repository holds my first platformer game built with Java.

*Note: this project uses Jackson FasterXML. You will need to include this if you want to compile this from source code as opposed to launching the runnable jar.*

/dist holds a runnable jar of a recent version build of the game (some code in repository is not included in MochiJump.jar currently)

The MochiJump App now can import customer levels built on http://mochijump.com

Recently done:

Added ability for Mochi to jump on NPCs and defeat them

To Do:

Improve NPC collision

Integrate Goal NPC with web app level editor
