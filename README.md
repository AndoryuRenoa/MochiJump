# MochiJump
This project has been mothballed, although I am still coming back to it from time to time.

## Recent Changes

The url for importing levels is now configurable. The application will try to read from a file in the same directory called "ImportUrl" if it is missing the program will use it's default url

Application now uses Log4j to print out log files. (WIP still needs to be added in some classes)
