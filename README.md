# MochiJump
Build v0.23 achieved.

This repository holds my first platformer game built with Java.

*Note: this project uses Jackson FasterXML. You will need to include this if you want to compile this from source code as opposed to launching the runnable jar.*

/dist holds a runnable jar of a recent version build of the game (current)

The MochiJump App now can import customer levels built on http://mochijump.com

Recently done:

Added HairClipNPC and created simple (placeholder) AI for it

Added ability to set Mochi's starting location as well as add npc on the level editor at http://mochijump.com
