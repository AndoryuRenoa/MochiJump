# MochiJump
First stable build v0.1 achieved.

This repository holds my first platformer game built with Java.

As this is a working repository, at any time, changes in code may make current code available in this repository unstable.

See MochiJump.java comments for current state. 

**** Curently working on a JS Level Editor Project for creating levelmaps for Mochi Jump to be integrated later ****
