# MochiJump
First stable build v0.2 achieved.

This repository holds my first platformer game built with Java.

Basic menu capability added:

Easy to do's:

Add keybinding in playable game to return to pause menu
Add variables for resizing the sprites and platform objects and play with it

More difficult to do's:

Create choose your level with database connection capability
Create a way to have screen follow mochi as he progress towards the edge of the screen. (easiest way I can think is to replace directional movement of sprite with the oposite directional movement of the other objects in the world)

As this is a working repository, at any time, changes in code may make current code available in this repository unstable. Dist holds a working version of this project
 

**** Curently working on a Level Editor Project for creating levels for Mochi Jump to be integrated later ****
