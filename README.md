# MochiJump
Build v0.23 achieved.

This repository holds my first platformer game built with Java.

/dist holds a runnable jar of a recent version build of the game (current)

The MochiJump App now can import customer levels built on http://mochijump.com

Recently done:

Added method to easily add gameCharacters


To Do:

fix "run off screen" for computers of a larger screensize. 

update MochiJump.com (MochiJumpLevelEditor) to include options to set Mochi's starting location and add option to add NPCs as part of level editor. 


*Note this project uses Jackson's Fasterxml. You will need to include this if you want to compile this from source code as opposed to launching the runnable jar.
