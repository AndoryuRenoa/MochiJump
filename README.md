# MochiJump
Build v0.23 achieved.

This repository holds my first platformer game built with Java.

/dist holds a runnable jar of a recent version build of the game (current)

The MochiJump App now can import customer levels built on http://mochijump.com

Recently done:

Added method to easily add gameCharacters


To Do:

Create NPCs

fix "run off screen" for computers of a larger screensize. 

Look into using callbacks to ensure proper initialization

Consider plan for reducing if statements for GameCharacter state

The POM.XLM has not been tested for dependency issues by launching with maven or compiling to a JAR yet

Try using Grandle in place of Maven for shipping.

Create UI and code for the option to select a level from the user made ones on MochiJump.com by level name, random level etc
