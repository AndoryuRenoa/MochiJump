# MochiJump
Build v0.22 achieved.

This repository holds my first platformer game built with Java.

The MochiJump App will now load the last created level at MochiJump.com as a playable level:
From Start Menu select "Load lvl" and then "Start" 

To Do:

updated source code has not been built into executable yet

Small delay while importing levels, maybe create a loading animation or feature.

The POM.XLM has not been tested for dependency issues by launching with maven or compiling to a JAR yet

Create UI and code for the option to select a level from the user made ones on MochiJump.com by level name, random level etc

Update collision rules so Mochi sprite behaves better on uneven surfaces
